here we are using following packages to amke sure our project flexible
    1.bcrypt --> to make our password into hash format
    2.Mangodb for database
    3.Mongoose for management
    4.next-auth for autentications

S2:
    1.delete app and public folder ->we are going build complete from scratch
        -> Create app folder newly to the root folder
        -> create Components folder newly  to the root folder
        -> create models newly  to the root folder -> For mongodb and mongose models perspective.
        -> Create public folder newly  to the root folder
        -> create styles folder newly  to the root folder
        -> utils folder newly  to the root folder -> for utility functions.
        -> .env file -> for stroing all our personal keys and hashes.

    2.add tailwind css in the tailwind config file and create global.css file under the styles folder create all our styles in that file.
    3.add all our assests into the public folder
    4.app->create page.jsx and layout.jsx tis file will act as home file to the layout.js it will handle all the components and files etc..
        -> layout.jsx file will be the root for the Browser. in thar function we need to pass {children} then we can access all the components from any folder.

    Error: If u start run the node it will through the error like styles.global.css error like that.to fix this
            -we have to open the jsconfig.json file there we will have
                    -> Remove   "@/*" forward slash(/), then everything will work properly..
                        {
                        "compilerOptions": {
                            "paths": {
                            "@/*": [
                                "./*"
                            ]
                            }
                        }
                        }
    
    S3:
        once we have done with above creation then we canmove to home file creation(app/page.jsx file)
    
    S4:
        Comonents Folder:
            -Feed.jsx
            -Form.jsx
            -Nav.jsx
            -Profile.jsx
            -PromptCard.jsx
            -Provider.jsx
        Once we have created above files under the component folder, then immediatly imoprt Feed.jsx in pages.jsx(Home File)

    S5:
        -Next we have to import Nav.jsx file in the layout.jsx file(app/layout.jsx).Bcz Navbar file we are going use in all our componets so layout js section is the root one . here we need to import and add
        - Similiarly we have to imoprt Provider.jsx foe useage of later on
        -NOTE: We need to add <Nav/> Components above the {children}, then Nav will stick to the top which means all the children components will comes under the Nav
    
    S6:
        -Nav.jsx Implementation
            -We need import Link,Image from next , Usestate,useeffect from react, 
            -Signin,Signout,useSession,getProviders from "next-auth/react these 4 will provide authnetication mesuerments
            -if the user is logged in then only we have to display the create-prompt button avalible otherwise we have to hiiden that button.
            -if the user is not loggedIn we should not display the create-post and signout button and all, that we have display only signIn button only..
            -to check the above line concet we need to work woth getProviders authentiation from next-auth/react, here we need to write useEffect remaing function to validate wheather the user is logged in or not
